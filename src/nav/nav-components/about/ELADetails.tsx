      Introduction One of the problem aspects in digital image forensics is the
      explanation of technical issues that are difficult to understand for
      laypeople. Even if the evidence of tampering is completely clear, pure
      technical papers are not comprehensible for the general public. There is
      the likelihood that sprawling complex description texts will not create
      acceptance. In the worst case, it causes an offensive negative attitude.
      The most accepted and widely understandable method that also provides many
      starting points for laypeople, is the detection of simple image
      compositions that can be found by the reverse image search function using
      major search engine providers. To see exactly where and in what manner a
      manipulation has been performed, is universally accepted as most
      persuasive evidence. For reconnaissance work that involves the public,
      visualization is one of the most effective means but it does not have to
      be the best. A visual method which has found its way in digital image
      forensics is called Error Level Analysis. However, there is a risk of
      misapplication. The use of ELA methodology must always be considered very
      carefully. ELA Analysis Error Level Analysis is based on characteristics
      of image formats that are based on lossy image compression. This method
      can highlight areas of an image which has different degrees of
      compression. Especially the JPEG format (one of the most popular image
      formats on the Internet) can be applied particularly well using this
      method. The procedure is surprisingly simple. For a better understanding
      it is necessary to know how images in JPEG format are created. JPEG uses a
      lossy image compression. Each re-encoding process (new saving) performed
      on the image leads to further loss of quality. The JPEG algorithm is based
      on a 8x8 pixel grid. Each 8x8 square grid is thereby treated and
      compressed separately. If the image is untouched, then all these 8x8
      squares will show the same error level potential. If the jpeg image is
      saved again, then each square should be continuously reduced to
      approximately the same level. In the ELA process, the original image that
      is being examined will be resaved at a certain JPEG quality level (for
      example, at 75%). The resave leads to a known degree of compression, which
      extends over the entire image. The newly saved image is used to be
      compared with the original image. The human eye would hardly notice a
      change. Therefore, the ELA representation will visualize in particular
      only the difference between the two images. So, the resulting ELA image
      shows the varying degrees of compression potentials. image Click to

      stands the idea that if an image has been edited, then every 8x8 square
      that is affected by the change, comprises a higher error level potential
      than the rest of the image. Case Studies Even without manipulation an
      image, the ELA view will show different areas in original images that come
      to the fore. These natural characteristics have to be known, if you want
      to be able to prove manipulations using this approach. (However, Error
      Level Analysis also has its limitations. This will be explained in the
      following chapters.) The ELA view highlights the different compression
      potentials produced in an image. Areas with uniform color, such as a
      cloudless blue sky or a bright white wall showing dark ELA results
      compared to the strongly contrast edges areas that occur much brighter in
      appearance. image Click to enlarge this image Homogeneous image regions
      like the sky on the example photo of the Colosseum can be compressed
      efficiently. Due to this, the compression potential is low at a
      recompression cycle respectively in a new saving and results in darker
      color on the ELA view. By contrast, irregular patterns containing fine
      contours and complex color and brightness gradients will show just few
      redundancies, which can not be reduced so well. Repeated saving of a JPG
      image removes high-frequency parts of an image and reduces the differences
      between strongly contrasting edges, textures and surfaces. A JPG image
      that is stored in the lowest quality level is displayed accordingly much
      darker than at higher quality levels. image Click to enlarge this image A
      JPEG file that creates a custom Huffman table based on statistical
      analysis of the respective image content, is called Progressive JPEG.
      Images generated by digital cameras, however, are not optimized in this
      way. Original shots from digital cameras should always have a high degree
      of change after a new save and thus have relatively bright areas in the
      ELA result. The very dark ELA result in the image example (showing the
      Colosseum) that has been stored in lower quality level, is a clearly
      recognizable indication that this image is in no way an original JPEG file
      that was downloaded directly from the camera. The following series of
      examples illustrates how a unique tamper evidence can look like by using
      the ELA approach. Even without being in possession of the original image
      (A1), the ELA view can show, where something has been changed in the image
      (A4). image Click to enlarge an image of the cutouts JPG images, which are
      stored in the lowest quality level (or maximum compression), appear very
      dark in the ELA result view (Example B2). If we add copied elements out of
      an image template that existed in higher quality level, than this will be
      clearly apparent in the ELA view (B4) by the much brighter areas. These
      copied elements have a considerably higher compression potential in
      contrast to the rest of the image. image Click to enlarge an image of the
      cutouts Manipulated - yes or no? It is not always possible to give a clear
      answer. Sample images, such as those shown above, clearly indicate the
      selective manipulation. But only in special cases like these ones the ELA
      methodology can show its strengths. However, ELA also have clear limits.
      The Bellingcat Case An incident that shows how the ELA methodology can be
      used too recklessly, is the Bellingcat reportExterner Link, that intends
      to pinpoint evidences for russian tampering of satellite images showing
      the crash site of the plane of "Malaysia Air MH17". On June 2015, the
      German online news service "Spiegel.de" had published an articleExterner
      Link with the results of the Bellingcat report. Shortly after the
      editorial staff had to publish a relativizing replyExterner Link and admit
      errors in journalistic research work because of fierce criticism. This new
      article also contains the review of the German image forensic specialist
      Jens crisis who commented very critically the Bellingcat report in an
      appropiate interviewExterner Link. The US forensics expert Dr. Neal
      Krawetz (founder of the online service FotoForensics.com), too, is quoted
      with the statement that what Bellingcat is doing is nothing more than
      reading tea leaves. What exactly is to criticize on the Bellingcat report?
      The Bellingcat report is based on more than just interpretations of ELA
      results. Essential components of the analysis describes verifiable changes
      in vegetation-tracks on the various satellite images and inconsistencies
      of details presented during the Russian press conference. It can be shown
      that the newspaper published satellite photos that are falsly dated were
      digitally altered by Adobe Photoshop CS5. However, the latter is a logical
      corollary, since the published images have been added with explanatory
      texts and markings. For these insertions it is necessary to use an image
      editing program. It should be left to the reader to evaluate the
      Bellingcat report as a whole in its conclusions. The Bellingcat report is
      considered here only in terms of dealing with the ELA methodology that
      makes out a significant portion of the report. The intention is to show
      that representation results produced by ELA methodology can very easily
      lead to critical mis- and over-interpretations of the results. In the
      embodiments of the Bellingcat reports, tested by Error Level Analysis of
      one of the published satellite photos, the areas with different levels of
      compression are marked with letters (A to E). In particular, it should be
      noticed the different compression ratio of the right cloud formation
      (section D) and the visible soil characteristics in the middle (area C).
      These differences may be explained by the fact that a cloud formation was
      subsequently inserted into the receptacle to hide compromising content.
      The figure shows the left portion, published by the website of the Russian
      Defense Satellite View and on the right side the display result by the
      Error Level Analysis. image Click to enlarge this image Quotation of the
      Bellingcat report (p.11): "The difference in the error levels between
      areas D and C cannot be explained by the imageâ€™s content. While error
      level differences may be caused by blurry image content, the clouds on the
      right side are sharply defined structures, so the error levels should not
      exhibit any significant deviations from the central part of the image in
      this field." Such a conclusion is entirely subjective in the course of an
      Error Level Analysis. This also applies to the claim that the differences
      can not explain holistically the image content. The severity of the error
      level that is expected on such an image is to be backed up with another
      comparison image from Google Earth with similar cloud from a different
      area. Bild Click to enlarge this image Quotation of the Bellingcat report
      (p.11): "This comparison photo shows how cloud cover very similar to that
      seen in "Picture 4" causes no significant differences in error levels.
      Therefore, it is highly likely that the cloud in "Picture 4" is not part
      of the original image and was added later." The ELA methodology is,
      however, no statistical evaluation method and assessment for possible
      probabilities. In which way can a high probability be derived? This is
      impossible. Accordingly, there is no mathematical description that
      explains the classification of an undetermined "high probability".
      Subjectively as well, is the rating of the comparative image. It lies in
      the eye of the observer, wether the error level changes are
      non-significant. Which measurement represents a relevant significance?
      Well, this is also an indeterminate size. The Error Level Analysis of an
      image that obviously has been changed by editorial staff is useless at
      this point. It can be concluded now that there have been countless edits
      that have elementarily influenced the final image. Furthermore it can be
      assumed that the original satellite image was present in a different image
      format and was converted in a lossy JPG file for posting it on the
      Internet . This image now has been greatly reduced by applying high
      compresion ratios and additonally has been overlaid with bars, marks and
      text boxes. As part of such an operations, a contrast and brightness
      increase is to be considered. It is also conceivable that selected
      portions of the template have been changed in contrast and brightness for
      presentation purposes. These are legitimate processing steps that not
      necessarily prove a manipulative intent of counterfeiting. The result of
      uneven error levels on such image template is hardly surprising and an
      expectable phenomenon. The wrong tool at the wrong examination object was
      applied. Pitfalls It is crucial to know the source from where an image
      comes from. A critical error in dealing with ELA methodology which is also
      evident in the Bellingcat report, is the use of an obviously prepared
      image template and not an original satellite image. Enforced answers The
      Bellingcat working group would have been better off if they had avoided
      any details associated with the use of ELA methodology. ELA results have
      finally no probative value. Instead, subjective evaluations entice to
      classic mistakes that sets an expected conclusion as the only solution in
      such investigations. Likewise, it may happen that there are no evidences
      for or against a willfully executed manipulation. Yes or no are not the
      only answer options. Real or authentic? If there is no information about
      the origin of the examined images, Error Level Analysis can not serve a
      binding statement as to whether an image is real or authentic. The logical
      distinction between these two cases is too often left unconsidered in
      connection with interpretations of ELA results. Indications of changes
      must be considered in the overall context. Selectively conducted graphical
      edits in the photo material could also simply have served to make them
      visually more recognizable, without distorting the general state of
      affairs. ELA methodology alone can not resolve this distinction.
      Limitations Compromising traces of manipulative image editing can be very
      easily removed in order to be immune to the ELA methodology. Unambiguous
      conviction through Error Level Analysis are also proof of amateurish
      workmanship of the counterfeiter comparable with the leave of fingerprints
      of the culprit at the scene. Imagery from social platforms Image material,
      mostly from various social platforms (like Facebook, Twitter, and others),
      are in particular unusable for ELA tests. When you upload the photos to
      online services, the photos are not applied by them in the original form.
      The online services in general create a complete new copy in a low quality
      version. This newly conducted encoding further reduces existing
      compression potentials. image Click to enlarge this image However, more
      things happen. Most of the meta information that existed in the original
      uploaded images have been removed. As a result, this will eliminate
      several different forensic examination criteria. At least, examination of
      the data structure and checking the ELA result can clearly determine that
      such images are not original camera image files. Conclusion Error Level
      Analysis may under certain conditions clearly indicate whether and where
      manipulations were made in the image. This definiteness is given, however,
      only in few cases. In the majority of professional forensic image analyses
      the ELA method is only used as one of various possible tools to obtain
      first hints which one can selectively pursue afterwards with further
      methods. Apart from those cases in which ELA can deliver an unambiguous
      result, it can not be invoked as evidence in other cases. In the
      conclusion of a serious forensic analysis you can not argue with alleged
      evidences. Either it is possible to give clear evidence of tampering or
      one abstains a binding statement due to the lack of usable data. Those who
      does it anyway, devalue the methods and especially himself as serious
      analyst by error-prone and negligent practices.
