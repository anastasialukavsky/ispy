        A picture is worth a thousand words, but what if that picture isn't
        telling the truth? In an era where images are easily manipulated, the
        challenge of distinguishing reality from fabrication has grown
        immensely. With modern editing tools, nearly any photo can be altered to
        misinform or mislead, making the task of uncovering these manipulations
        more crucial than ever. Traditional methods often focus on identifying
        visual inconsistencies or errors that betray the use of editing
        software. While this can be effective, it's not always sufficient.

        Some images may not display obvious signs of tampering, leaving those
        methods inconclusive. That’s where data-driven analysis comes into play.
        Hidden within the digital makeup of an image are subtle traces that
        reveal manipulation—traces that are invisible to the naked eye but speak
        volumes to a trained tool. By analyzing these data points through
        advanced algorithms like Error Level Analysis, Noise Analysis, Copy-Move
        Detection, and Metadata Extraction, we can uncover the truth behind an
        image, offering unparalleled insights into whether it has been altered.
        This tool opens a new frontier in image authentication, ensuring that
        what we see aligns with reality and empowering us to verify the
        integrity of images with confidence.
